                feel that way, so our refund policy is simple: If you’re ever
                unhappy with copilot, for any reason, just contact our support
                team and we’ll take care of you
              </p>
              <h4>Examples of full refunds we’d grant.</h4>
              <ul role="list">
                <li>
                  If you were just charged for your next month of copilot, but
                  you meant to cancel, we’re happy to refund that extra charge.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you forgot to cancel copilot a couple months ago, and you
                  haven’t used copilot since then, we’ll give you a full refund
                  for a few back months. No problem.
                </li>
                <li>

                  projects, or storage space, although you did keep using
                  copilot in general, we’d consider applying a prorated credit
                  towards future months.
